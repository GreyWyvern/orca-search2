*** Answers
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. When executing the spider, this error message appears: "Undefined
index: queue"

   This means your Starting URI(s) was/were rejected by the parser.
Thus when the spider tries to go to the first URI in the queue, it finds
that the queue is empty.

Return to the Control Panel and double check that you have typed in a
valid Starting URI, and that no other rules you have inserted in the
Spider Options conflict and actually block your Starting URI.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. When executing the spider, this error message appears: "fsockopen():
unable to connect to www.example.com:80"

   First, double check your Starting URIs to see if you may have mis-
typed them and pointed to a non existant domain.

Next, a few hosting companies specifically block traffic originating
from one of their servers, trying to contact itself via HTTP.  I plan to
include a list of these hosting companies here, eventually as there is
little I can do within the script to overcome this.  The best thing to
do, if you find yourself in this situation, would be to host your spider
on a different domain than the files you are indexing, if possible.

Please let me know if you are getting this error, so I can see if it
should be added to my list.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. No matter what I do, this/these entries are marked as "Orphan".  Is
this bad?

   Orphan pages are pages not linked to any document in a domain listed
in your Allowed Domains list.  So, if you add http://www.example.com to
your Entry List manually, but do not include www.example.com in your
Allowed Domains, it will be marked as an Orphan no matter what else you
do.

Sometimes this is desirable behavior, since you can specifically add
pages this way, and prevent the spider from grabbing other pages at that
domain, without resorting to complicated Ignore URI rules.  For example,
if you want to index *only* the front page of Yahoo!, but do not want to
spider any links there, you can manually add http://www.yahoo.com/ to
your Entry List, but *don't* add www.yahoo.com as an Allowed Domain.
This means that all the links the spider finds on this page which stay
within the www.yahoo.com domain will be automatically discarded.

It is very important to note that Orphaned pages ARE STILL INDEXED.
They will be scanned for content and stored for searching, even though
they won't appear in any search results by default.  If you would like
to display Oprhaned pages in your search results, you can switch on the
"Show Orphans" option in the Search Panel.

4. I want users to be able to search through all of my pages even though
some are marked as "Orphan".

   Go to the Search Panel, and check the Show Orphans option.  Orphan
pages will now appear in your search results.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. There are many pages at my website which I don't want to spider, but
they are in many different locations.  Do I have to make up "Ignore URI"
rules for all of them?

   Not at all.  The easiest way to deal with a situation like this is
to create Ignore URI rules for the easiest subsets to block, and then
simply allow the spider to crawl all the rest.  Once the spider has run,
go to the Entry List panel and manually Unlist the pages which you don't
want to appear in your search results.

   When you manually Unlist an entry, the "Unlisted" status will stay
with it from spider to spider without further input.  To relist it
again, simply do so from the Entry List panel.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. What is a phpinfo(); file?

A phpinfo(); file is a simple text file containing the following line:

<?php phpinfo(); ?>

Save that text file as info.php and upload it to your server.  When you
request this file through a web browser, it will display a great deal of
useful information about your server's PHP installation.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Can I run this script in PHPs Safe Mode?

Yes you can, but there are a few limitations.  These limitations are as
follows:

 a) The Spider cannot extend the script timeout limit.  If your database
is large, the spider may time out before it spiders all pages.  This
also applies to the JWriter.

 b) The Spider may be unable to remove temporarily downloaded binary
data from the /temp directory, requiring you to "clean it out" every now
and then.

... More limitations of Safe Mode may arise as I hear about them.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. I set up a crontab, but it does not email me automatically.  How can
I make it do so?

This is usually the case when you are required to set up the crontab
manually, rather than through a host's control panel.  If so, you will
need to add the code to email you as an addition to the crontab command.

The command to add to your crontab is as below:

| /usr/bin/mail -s "Email subject" address@example.com

This will send the output from your crontab, with the subject as listed,
to the email address provided.  /usr/bin/mail is the path to your
server's sendmail service.  Your completed crontab command will look
like this (all on one line):

/usr/bin/php /path/to/the/spider.php | /usr/bin/mail -s "Email subject"
 address@example.com

If you still have problems with this setup, make sure to ask your host
if there are any special setup details required.

9. Can I remove the "An Orca Script" footer from the body.xhtml.php?

Obviously I would prefer if you left the link there as a thank-you for
the script :)  However, I have no problems with removal of the footer,
and you will not be violating any licence conditions if you do so.
